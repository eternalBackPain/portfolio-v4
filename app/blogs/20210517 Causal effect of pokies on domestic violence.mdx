# Causal effect of pokies on domestic violence

This is a paper I wrote for my applied microeconometrics class. I wrote it in response to a [legislative amendment](https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/repealed/current/act-2018-009) that reduced the amount of pokies available to certain areas of NSW. I found no statistical significance between the number of pokies and domestic violence.
