# NSW Property Data Analysis

Constructing a database of and visualising NSW property price and rental data across suburbs over the past 5 years. Originally posted on my [Github](https://github.com/eternalBackPain/NSW-Property-Data/tree/main).

This data is incredibly difficult to source without an expensive subscription to a service that licences its data from the Department of Finance and Services, Land and Property Information.

This analysis is geared towards retail investors. It provides a general snapshot of the NSW property market with some interesting insights on inter-LGA differences.
